<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Hullo, Lorany! didn’t know yer was thar.
What makes yer so glum? (<em>Aside</em>) Oh, the caarf, I bet!
Say, Lorany, I’m plaguy sorry I sold the caarf. I’d buy her
back, but the fellers ’d laf at me. I told some on ’em haow
bad yer felt, daown to the store. And old Pete Rosson, he was
a-sittin’ on a kintle o’ salt fish; he said: “Wimmin’s rights! I
s’pose Mis’ Gandy went ter the meetin’ and heerd the lectur’-woman.
I guess Mis’ Rosson wouldn’t dare ter complain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
ef I sold one o’ her caarfs. I’d let her know they was <em>mine</em>,
double quick.” Won’t yer take up yer money, Lorany?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<em>dusting</em>). No! Nathan, I won’t! So, there! It
’ill hev to stay there, wher’ it dropped, for all o’ me; for I’ll
never pick it up as long as I live. I tho’t all we had was
aourn together, and that everything belonged as much ter me
as it does ter you. But I see naow that it’s as the lectur’-woman
sed. I read it in the <em>Transkip</em>:—“Husband and
wife is one, but that one is the husband.” I shouldn’t ’a’ tho’t
o’ sellin’ yaour caarf or yaour best caow. You call ’em yaourn,
an’ the caarf was allus called mine. An’, then, little Sally,
that’s gone, tho’t so much on’t! (<em>Wipes her eyes.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Hang it! don’t take on so. (<em>Aside</em>) Darn them
fellers, flingin’ their wimmin’s right at me! (<em>To her</em>) Who
cares what the lectur’-woman says? Some darned old maid, or
divorced widder, I s’pose. Didn’t I buy suthin’ for yer with
the money! Didn’t I buy yer a gaown, a shawl, an’ a bunnit!
An’, when yer didn’t like ’em, didn’t I give yer all the
money back, and yer wouldn’t take it! An’ didn’t yer fling it
daown on the floor, an’ vaow you wouldn’t pick it up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Yes, but yer never as’d me! an’ I didn’t want
her sold, nuther! You know haow I took care o’ that caarf.
Her mother died, an’ never saw her. I almost feel as if she
was mine; for I brought her up like a baby, and she sucked
milk from my finger before she could stan’. I’m sure I’m as
much her mother as harf the hens are mothers of their
chickens: for they never see some o’ the eggs till they are
put under ’em to hatch, an’ they don’t know which is which.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Waal! yaou’ve got yer new things, hain’t ye?
an’ I’m glad on’t. I’m abaout sick o’ them black clo’es o’
yourn. They look so maugre. For my part, I want ter see
yer in suthin’ bright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I sh’d think yer did! Yer tho’t I was abaout
sixteen, didn’t yer? (<em>Opens the door at the back, and produces
a very showy piece of dress goods, a shawl of a very
loud pattern, and a bonnet trimmed with green and red and
yellow</em>) Look a’ that! What do you think o’ them things!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Young enough for Mary, or Leafy Jane, either. I never wore
such bright things when I was a gal; an’ I’m sure I ain’t a-gwine
ter begin naow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> I don’t see why, Lorany! They ain’t no
brighter than the marygoolds, pecuniaries (<em>petunias</em>), and
dadyoluses, yer like so well, in the garden, or even the persalter
roses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> That’s a different thing. I ain’t a flower-garden;
I do wish the men-folks ’d let their wives buy their own
clo’es, or give ’em the money to buy ’em with. (<em>Sits down
and braids on her mat.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Why, Lorany! the wimmen folks ain’t used to
layin’ out money. We can make it spend a great deal better
’n they can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> P’r’aps yer can; but we’d like what we bought
ourselves a great deal better; I do wish they’d let us buy our
own clo’es, I say, or give us the money to buy ’em with, so’s
we could suit ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Wall, I snum, yer as bad as the lectur’-woman
Pete Rosson told on. He said she said wimmen ortter
have their own private pusses, same’s the men, and other
things tew; and that the Legislater ort to see tew’t, but that
they was tew busy,—trying to settle the size of a bar’l o’
cramberries, an’ talkin’ baout sellin’ eggs by weight, and sich
things,—to care what becomes o’ wimmin’s rights. Sellin’
eggs by weight! what durned nonsense! Some on ’em would
take twenty to make a paound, and some wouldn’t take mor’n
eight, an’ where’d yer cookin’ go ter, I’d like ter know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Waal, Nathan, I don’t care nuthin’ abaout that!
I shall put twelve eggs inter my old-fashioned paound cake,
as the recipee sez, whether they’re big or little. But I do
care about the caarf. I’d almost rather you’d ’a’ sold
<em>me</em>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Wall, I vum to vummy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> You knew haow much I allus tho’t on her ’cause
little Sally loved her so; an’ ’afore she died she’d be’n a-readin’
some o’ them old pictur’-books, an’ she said the caarf had eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
just like one on ’em in it, an’ so she named the caarf May
Donna, or some sich name. (<em>Wipes her eyes.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Consarn it all! Lorany, don’t cry! There!
There! I’ll pick up the money, Lorany, I’ll pick up the
money. (<em>Aside</em>) I wonder if there <em>is</em> anything in them wimmin’s
rights, after all! (<em>Puts the money in his pocket. Sits
in chair tipped back against the wall, and eats an apple, cutting
it with his jack-knife.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<em>looking up</em>). Where yer be’n all the arternoon?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Ben to the wharf, chippin’.</p>

<p>L. J. (<em>lisping</em>). Yeth, we chipped and got our bathkeths
full, and the thkipperth (<em>skipper’s</em>) boy, he thed, ‘There, take a
log’—and we took one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> The skipper’s boy!—who’s he?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. He’s the skipper’s son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> What skipper’s son?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Why! the captain of the Betsey Ludgitt. He’s
down there to the wharf, unloadin’ his wood. And his boy,
he’s real hunkey! He give me all these butnuts (<em>shows them</em>)
and this gum,—see this gum,—real spruce gum!—none
o’ your Burgundy pitch and candle-grease, such as you buy
to the store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Gum! Then I s’pose you’ll go to chawin’ agin!</p>

<p>J. Q. A. I’ll bet I will. Its rippin’ good! (<em>Chews.</em>)</p>

<p>L. J. (<em>lisps</em>). Marm, he sthiks hith cud on the head-board,
and it makth a white plathe. I theen it when I make the
bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Sticks his cud on the head-board! What on
airth do you mean?</p>

<p>L. J. Yeth, hith cud o’ gum. He doth it motht every
night, when he <em>hath</em> gum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> What do you do that for?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. I stick it there when I go to sleep, so when I
wake up in the middle of the night I can have a good chaw
to pass away the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> John Quincy Adams Gandy! What’ll yer do
next!</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Go a-fishin’, I guess, marmy. (<em>Kisses her.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> What’s the skipper’s name?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Miller—Solomon Miller; and his son’s name’s
William.</p>

<p>L. J. And the cook’th name ith Henry Mudgett.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> The cook! What der yer know abaout the
cook?</p>

<p>L. J. He’th real nithe. I thaw him lath fall. Hith
mother an’ grandfather live down to Nantucket. Hith grandfather
thalth (<em>salts</em>) down fith, nam’th (<em>name’s</em>) Zabulon, and
they have a big houth an’ a lot of land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> A lot o’ sand, I guess you mean. Haow’d yer
come ter know ’em so well?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Oh! They was up here in the fall when we went
a-chippin’ with Mary, and they talked with us a good deal.</p>

<p>L. J. Yeth, an’ the thkipper’th thon kept lookin’ at
Mary.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Yes, and so did Hank at you.</p>

<p>L. J. Hith name ain’t Hank! it’h Henry!</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Oh, Lawks!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Whar <em>is</em> Mary?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. We left her down to the wharf, an’ she was a
talkin’ to the skipper’s son.</p>

<p>L. J. Yeth, and the thkipper came out, and he talked, an’
they all laughed, and he thed to John Pin, “Run along, Totty,
with your log o’ wood. They’ll foller ye, an’ tell yer pa an’
ma all about it.”</p>

<p>J. Q. A. I guess I aint Totty! (<em>Chewing.</em>) I seen ’em
an’ after they done it,—</p>

<p>L. J. Oh, John Pin Ad! you muthn’t thay ‘I theen,’ <em>Mary</em>
theth. You can’t thay ‘theen’ nor ‘done,’ unleth you can thay
have’ before it; an’ you can’t thay ‘I theed,’ at all.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. I guess I can too. Mary needn’t feel so big
’cause she’s ben to Bradford ’cademy three months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>L. J. Yeth, you mutht thay ‘I have thawed,’ and ‘I hain’t
theen,’ and ‘I have did,’ and ‘I hain’t done it,’ and you’ll be
right.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Poh! you ain’t right at all! Hear me. You
must say ‘I have done, I have seen,’ or ‘I saw and I did’; and
you must never say ‘I seed, I sawed, I seen,’ nor ‘I done it.’
That’s what <em>Mary</em> says.</p>

<p>L. J. Father thayth ‘I theen and I done’; and I gueth
what father theth ith about right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> O child! Yer mustn’t talk as I do. Mary
knows what’s proper to say, better’n yer old dad. He
never had no edication. There was no ’cademy for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Nor me, nuther. Gals wa’n’t ’lowed to go to
school in my time, daown to Plymouth, when my folks lived
there. There was too many boys wanted to go; and the gals
had to stay ter hum, to make room for ’em.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">(<em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <em>and</em> <span class="smcap">William</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Father, here’s Captain Miller’s son. I made his
acquaintance down at the wharf last fall. (<em>Goes to</em> <span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span>,
<em>seats herself on a stool near her, and arranges rags, and
hands them to her</em>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> (<em>rising and shaking hands with</em> <span class="smcap">Will</span>). Is that
<em>so</em>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> Yes! and, when I went home, I told the folks
all about her and the children, and the Captain and Mrs.
Gandy; and mother said one of her girl friends, a real intimate,
married a Gandy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> What was her name afore she was married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Plumy Johnson, as I’m alive!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> Yes, her name was Plumy—Plumy Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<em>shaking his hand</em>) Wal, if ain’t right glad ter
see yer. Set right daown an’ tell us all abaout your folks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will</span> (<em>sitting</em>). There ain’t much to tell. Father, he’s
skipper of the Betsey Ludgitt, and we live in North Pittston,
Maine. We’ve got a nice little place there, and there’s
ten of us children. I am the oldest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> (<em>sitting</em>). Haow long yer be’n skippin’?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> About five years. I’ve got so now I can handle a
boat, and one of the other boys is going to take my place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> What are you goin’ ter dew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> There’s a man out West, clear beyond the Ohio,
that wants me to run a boat on the Mississippi, up and down.
It’s a steamboat. He’s got a good mate for her that knows
all about the ingine, and he says I can learn the ropes about
that fast enough. But I don’t know. I hate to go so far
from home, and almost alone too. (<em>He looks conscious.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I should think yer would. Don’t stand gawpin’
raound, Leafy Jane. Go ’long and git yer knittin’-work.
(L. J. <em>obeys and seats herself on the log</em>. J. Q. A. <em>bothers
her</em>.) And yer marm, what does she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> Oh! marm, she hates to have me go; but she’s
more willing than she would be, ’cause Hank Mudgitt, a likely
Nantucket boy, wants to go with me, to be the cook. He’s
been cooking for father. His marm was a Folger, and knew
my marm when she lived to Nantucket, and she says I’d
better not lose the chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Folger? Folger? Why! I’ve heerd that name
afore. I knew a Captain Folger onct, of the barque Hulda
Griggs. He had a lot o’ boys, an’ one on ’em went to college,
and turned out a smart lawyer. I guess yer’d better
not lose the chance. Lots o’ boys go West, and they do
well, or they don’t come back to tell us. Horace Greeley told
’em all to go West, in his <em>Trybune</em>, you know, when he wrote
the whole on’t. “Go West, young man,” he says, though he
didn’t go himself. But I s’pose his advice was jest as good,
same as the guide-board p’ints the way it never goes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> The man that wants me says it’s a good steamboat,
with a nice, clean cabin for a family to live in, if a captain had
one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Is it a side-wheeler or a skre-you?</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Oh! father, all them Mississippi steamboats are
side-wheelers, and they have to be made flat-bottomed on account
of the snags in the river, and the shallow water, so’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
they can run ’em right up to the shore, where there’s no
landing. Oliver Optic says so in one of his books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Dew tell! I’d ruther have a sailin’ vessel. Give
me a good three-masted schaouner, with a spankin’ breeze to
make her go, and a bower anchor to cast when she comes
inter port.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> The man says he’ll pay me so much a year, enough
to live on, and give me a certain per cent on the freight, and a
chance to buy into the vessel in two years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> A smackin’ good chance, I should say. I advise
yer to snap at it. When does he want ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> Right off, in a month or so, and now, if I could get
anybody, besides Hank Mudgitt, to go with me (<em>looks at</em>
<span class="smcap">Mary</span>), I shall write right off and accept the offer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Somebody ter go with ye besides Hank!

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> What on airth do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span>) Yes, but I want somebody, somebody
to be—my—wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Dew tell! What kind of a wife do yer want?
Not one o’ them gals that wears bangs an’ boot-heels, an’ go
a-teetering along the road?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> No, I don’t want one of that kind. Mary—Mary
says she’ll go with me if you are both willing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Aour Mary! Mary Gandy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Wal, I swan to man!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Why! Mary, where’d he git a chance to ask
yer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I saw him first, mother, as I told you, last fall,
when I went down to the wharf with the children, chipping.
You know you didn’t want them to go alone. He said then
he should come back in the spring, and hoped he’d see me
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> And I have seen her several times; and the other
day I told her about the steamboat, and she ’lowed she was
willing to go with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I thought she was ’mazin’ fond o’ chippin’ all to onct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span>. I guess you mean that ‘I promised,’ don’t you,
William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Will.</span> Yes, you promised, and I told father; and he said
he guessed it was all right. He’d known o’ Captain Gandy
quite a spell. The Nancy Paige lay at the wharf alongside
the Betsey Ludgitt once, down to Castine.</p>

to get my things and what money I’ve saved up, then come

I ought to read my Bible more, but here’s this book on

It seems fresh all the time. I like to study it, too, when I

seems to come natural to me to know all about a boat, and I
love any kind of a one. How they skip round the bend of
the river, and over the sea, at home! I wonder why they
call a vessel <em>she</em>! Father says they ought to call steamboats

Jo-see-phus, Herodytus Miller. (<em>Exit</em> <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p>(<em>Re-enter</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, <em>half supporting</em> <span class="smcap">Captain Miller</span>,
<em>who tries to walk; he sits down near the table wearily</em>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> (<em>feebly</em>). It’s no use, Mary, I can’t walk. I
can’t use my legs a mite, and that’s a fact. The malaria has
settled in them, and I don’t know as I shall ever walk
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>stands beside him, and keeps her eye on the vessel’s
course</em>). Yes, you will, dear. The doctor says so; and he
says you must get away from the boat, go into the mountains
and stay awhile, and then you will be as well as
ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> Oh, Mary! If I could only go to New England.
I feel as if it would cure me. If I could only go to Maine,
and see the White Hills, all covered with snow on top, from
behind father’s house, see mother, and have some of their
good victuals—(<em>He breaks down.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You <em>shall</em> go. It won’t cost any more to go
there than it will to pay your board at some place near the
mountains; and no matter if it does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> How can I leave the vessel? If I take the
money to go East with, I shan’t be able to meet my payments,
and shall lose my chance of buying into her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Patsy</span>). Ease her off a couple of points. (<em>To</em>
<span class="smcap">William</span>) Never mind that! Don’t worry. It’s better to
lose everything else than to lose your health. But you will
not lose the boat. I can run her while you’re gone. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
three months! The doctor says he thinks that will
do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> I don’t know about your running the boat,
Mary. Ours is a thousand-mile trip, you know, next time,
and it’s easier to come down than it is to go up. The Yellow-red
winds like a corkscrew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I know that, William; but I think I can manage
her. I have done it; and here we are safe so far, and
no accident yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> (<em>considering</em>). This cargo is secure, and the
next one all promised. But I hate to leave you, Mary, and
the baby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Patsy</span>). Keep her on her course, boy! (<em>To</em>
<span class="smcap">William</span>) I hate to have you go, William, only I know
that it is for your good; and then, if I go, you’ll have to give
up the boat, and we shan’t have anything to live on; and
that will never do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> You’re right, Mary, as you always are.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">(<em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Hank</span>, <em>the cook, with a waiter full of dishes</em>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> (<em>drawling</em>). Yes, it is, sir. It’s an hour. And

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Patsy</span>, <em>hurriedly</em>). Hard a-port, there! Give

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">William</span>). Waal, tha’s some fixings the Indians

how to cook ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> What are they, Hank? Name over your bill
of fare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Waal, cap, this ere’s corn-pone, o’ coose; and a
dodger or so; a slice o’ bacon; a helter-skelter; some succotash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
two frog’s legs pealed and sizzled; a pigeon biled in
milk; some baked punkin; eel’s tails soused; and some no-cake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> What! what! what! Are you going to stuff
me to death, or poison me—which?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Oh, sir! you needn’t eat ’em all. The Injuns
said if you eat just the right thing for you, you’d be sure
to get well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> I dare say. They’d cure a dog with their
charms and their notions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Some of the vittals is good, and some pretty middlin’
poor, but it’s all good for suthin’,— or the pigs!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> (<em>laughing</em>). I shouldn’t wonder. (<em>Looking
over the waiter.</em>) What’s baked punkin for, Hank? It
looks like raw, dried potato-parings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> The Indians said ’twas to chaw, and give you an
appetite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>from the wheel-house</em>). What in the world are
the soused eel’s-tails for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Oh, to make you feel lively, and cherk you up a
little. They make brains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> What next? What’s the no-cake for, and
where is it? Cake sounds kind o’ good. And hot biscuit.
Mother’s hot biscuit! Oh! how I should like some of
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Well, the no-cake is that aire white stuff piled up
on that aire plate. It looks like something goodish; but
when you chaw it, it feels like sand. The Injuns eat it, and
they said ’twould make the cap’n sleep good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> I should think it would,—and dream of my
grandmother. If it chews like sand, it will be heavy
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> There ain’t no decent vittals for a sick man to eat
in these diggings. ’Tain’t half so good as the Nantucket
feed, such as my marm used to cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> Oh, Hank! don’t speak of it! How I should
like some fried perch,—some good fresh salt-water perch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
with their heads on; and some steamed clams, fresh-dug
Nantucket clams, with the shells all gaping at you. I feel as
if I could eat a good four-quart tin pan full this minute,
shells and all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> I’d like to make you a rippin’ good chowder, sir.
Such as we have ter hum. What you want is real, good,
hard, fresh cod-fish or haddock, head and all, some white
potatoes (none o’ your flat yellow sweets), some onions, some
Boston crackers, and a generous rasher of salt strip pork
(none o’ your middlings). But I can’t do it. They never
heerd of a Boston cracker, and there ain’t a decent piece o’
fresh salt-water fish between here and Nantucket. Only
this darned canned stuff; and that’s enough to p’isen a
feller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">William</span>, <em>from the wheel-house</em>). You’ll have
some chowder when you get home, dear; and you’ll eat
again of all the old New England food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Oh, sir! you goin’ hum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> I think of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Hank</span>). Yes, he <em>is</em> going home; and pretty
soon, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> If you do, sir, I hope you’ll take a skip down to
Nantucket, and see my folks. Marm ’ll be mighty glad to
see you. I’ll write to her, and send her some money, and
you can take the letter, sir, right along. And please, sir,
fetch me word how the old place looks, and if marm seems
comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> Yes, Hank, I’ll take your letter; and if I can’t
go to see your mother, I will send it to her by express.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Thank you, sir, thank you; and if you should go
to Annisport, and see Miss Leafy Jane, please tell her I
hain’t forgot her, and if you can say I’ve been a good feller—and
behaved tip-top—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> Why, Hank! do you remember that little fly-away?
You steady old boy, you. Of course you’ve been a
good fellow, and I’ll tell her so,—if I see her,—but why
don’t you write to her yourself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Oh, sir! she might not like it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. M.</span> That’s so. Well, do as you like, Hank.
You can leave the waiter. I will eat all I can of your concoctions.

<p class="center no-indent">(<em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Mr. Romberg</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>slowly and deliberately</em>). Mrs. Miller, I came to
see what you were going to do about the boat. Your husband
has been gone a long time; and it seems there is no
prospect of his immediate return. So we might as well talk
the matter over now as at any other time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>rises and offers him a seat</em>). Mr. Romberg? I
don’t know as I have seen you before. You are the largest
owner in the Creole Bride, I believe? Why do you wish to
know what I am going to do? (<em>Sitting.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>sitting</em>). I (and the other owners) don’t want
the boat to be eating her head off here at the wharf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> We shall not stay here longer than this afternoon.
As soon as I come to terms with my mate, I shall be
ready to steam her up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> I don’t see how you can run this boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>rising</em>). Why not, sir? I <em>have</em> run her for the
last three or four months. I carried her ’way up the Red
and Yellow, and down again to Baton Rouge, through
the most crooked part of our whole thousand-mile route; and
I steered most of the time myself. The mate don’t know
much about handling the wheel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> The merchants, I find, are not willing to trust
you with a cargo; so I don’t see but you will have to give it
up. You won’t be able to meet your payments; and I must
look out for my own property, as well as that of the rest of
the owners, for it is all in my care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Is not Mr. Miller’s contract as captain of the boat
all right? It does not expire till next year. He is all
paid up to the first of the month; and I hope to be able
to pay the next quarter,—that is, if I can go on running the
boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Yes, madam; but you must understand that the
contract is with <em>Captain Miller</em>, and not with his wife; that
is where the trouble is. Husband and wife are not one in
this business. Captain Miller’s contract <em>is</em> all right, and he
<em>is</em> paid up; but if he dies, the whole thing will have to
be settled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>alarmed</em>). But my husband is <em>not</em> dead. He is
not going to die! Why can’t I run the boat up to Cairo?
I have a full cargo, and another is promised there. I know
the route for the next three months. I have been over it
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>rising</em>). Mrs. Miller, you cannot be a captain in
name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But, Mr. Romberg, I <em>am</em> the captain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> No, Mrs. Miller. You may run the boat, but
you cannot act as captain,—you have no license. The
fact is, the law does not allow it. That is what the owners
say; and we consulted a lawyer, and he gave it as his opinion,
<em>after careful consideration</em>, that a woman cannot be
master of a vessel legally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Then we must lose our chance of owning the
boat; and I cannot raise the money needed for the support
of my poor sick husband and my little baby,—just because
I am a woman! Oh! Mr. Romberg! this is hard indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> I suppose it is rather hard; but that is the way
of the law, in Louisiana, at least, and I think all over the
United States. When our fathers framed the constitution,
they thought it was better that woman should be confined to
the domestic sphere. The home, the home is their place,—not
the decks of vessels. They wanted to protect women in
their proper sphere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Protect them! Hinder them, I should think!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>approaching</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). If Captain Miller, now,
were not living, you might find some likely river-man to
marry you, and be captain of the boat, in name; and then
you could keep on acting as master,—your mate, perhaps,—then
you’d be all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Marry! The mate! Patsy! Oh, Mr. Romberg!
Oh, sir! what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>aside</em>). Gad! the women are all alike. How
they stick to one man! (<em>To her</em>) I don’t see what else you
can do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> There was Captain Tucker’s wife; after he died
she took the boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Yes, but she did not run it long; all of us
owners objected to a petticoat captain, and we discharged
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>severely</em>). Then what has become of her and all
her six children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Oh, she tends in a lager-beer saloon in Natchez.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>indignantly</em>). Yes, and I suppose her children
are given away or put out to service—all because she is a
woman! She has to do this degrading work to get an honest
living, and all because you wouldn’t allow her to do the only
work she always had done and was best fitted to do. She
run the boat three years before her husband died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Well, she might have married and had some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
to be her captain. The merchants sent one of their best
river-men to marry her, but she ordered him off the boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> I don’t blame her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> There ain’t much a woman can do round here
<em>but</em> get married. There’s many a likely man that is <em>not</em> a
river-man who would like to get a good smart Yankee woman
like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>sharply</em>). Mr. Romberg! what do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> I mean, of course, if your husband does not come

<p>Mary (<em>turning away</em>). Oh! What shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> My dear Mrs. Miller! you must be as wise as a
serpent as well as harmless as a dove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, sir! how can I be wise without money, without
friends, with my hands tied by a little child, and my means
of earning a living taken away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Well, there is a month or two yet before I shall
be obliged to ask you to give up your husband’s papers.
Meanwhile, you can go on to Cairo, and come back; go
along the Red and Yellow, and leave your cargo. You
needn’t take on any more. I’ll see you again when you
come down to New Orleans; and then, if your husband has
not returned, we must close up our accounts. That is what
the rest of the owners say, and I agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Mr. Romberg! is there nothing I can do to
keep the boat? Can I not get a license? Did a woman
never have a captain’s license?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> I never heard of one. And I don’t think there
ever was one. It would be absurd! But I must bid you
good-morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Good-morning, sir. (<em>Exit</em> <span class="smcap">Mr. Romberg</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>)
Indeed! what kind of a woman does he take me to be! Telling
<em>me</em> about marrying another man so as to have a captain!
I will show him that I can be master of my own boat. <em>I</em> go
into a lager-beer saloon! As Mary Gandy I would not have
done it; and as Mary Miller I certainly shall not. <em>I</em> give up
the boat! My William’s boat? Never! Unless they put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
me on shore by force. <em>Why</em> cannot <em>I</em> get a license? <em>I’ll
try!</em> and then, if worst comes to worst, I must make my way
somehow back home again. If I could only hear from
mother! (<em>Sits down at the table—arranges papers.</em>)</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Mary</span>,—<br>
</p>

<p class="fs90"><span style="padding-left: 2em">Mother</span> wants me to write. She says: Tell Mary
that I talked it all over with your father, and he asked old Pete
Rosson, and then I wrote to the lecture woman up to Boston, and
she says you must have a captain’s license so’s you can keep the
boat. And she says you must apply to the Local Inspectors
(here is a blank for you to fill out), and that if you pass your examination
they will see that it is sent to Washington to the Solicitor
of the Treasury. You must write to Mr. Le Brun or Mr.
Cholmly, Local Inspectors, New Orleans, La. Do it right off
before Mr. Romberg gets a chance to take away the boat. And
oh! mother says you must sign your own name to the application—Mary
Miller, or Mary Gandy Miller (’cause it isn’t legal to
sign your husband’s name, and <em>Mrs.</em> is nothing but a title). She’s
found out that a woman has no more right, legally, to use her husband’s
first name and title than he has to use hers. She says
Martha Washington had more sense than to call herself Mrs.
George, or Mrs. General, or Mrs. President Washington. Plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Martha Washington was good enough for her. And oh! the
folks round here are real proud of you, to think you can manage a
steamboat, and old Pete Rosson says “it’s a darned shame you
have such a hard time, and he hopes you won’t give up the ship.”
He expects to go to the Legislature this winter, and he says “if
the men at Washington don’t let you have the captain’s license,
he’ll vote agin every mother’s son on ’em.”</p>

<p class="center no-indent">(<em>Enter</em> <span class="smcap">Mr. Romberg</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Good-day, Mrs. Miller. I am sorry to be obliged
to proceed against you, and ask you to deliver up your husband’s
papers. <em>I</em> might be willing to wait a little longer; but
the other owners are not satisfied. They say that as you
cannot get a captain’s license, some man must take the
boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Cannot get a captain’s license? How do you
know that? I have applied for one; and am expecting every
minute to hear from Washington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> I know that. Here is the <em>Delta</em> with a long
account of your case, and the decision of the Solicitor
of the Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>coming forward</em>). Let me see it! I have heard
nothing about it. We have had no mail since we got in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>reads from the newspaper emphatically</em>). “One
of the richest papers on the woman question that has ever
emanated from an official source is the opinion of Solicitor
Rayner on the question whether licenses should be granted
women to command steamboats. He says: ‘Instead of
being master in name, while some one else performs the duties,
why does she not let some one else be master in name?
She would not stand her watch at night in the cold. She
would not enforce the discipline on a Mississippi steamer.
She would not tramp to the rooms of shippers and consigners
to do the banking business—’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>interrupting</em>). Why! that is just what I have
been doing for the last five months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>reads on</em>). “‘All the accounts concur in describing
the lady who makes this application as one of high character,
business qualifications, and highest worth. But, in
the application of what is with me a principle, the higher the
character and worth, the greater my difficulty in asking that
the license asked for to command a Mississippi steamboat
be granted. Because it would be assigning a position to
woman which God, in his providence, never intended her to
fill.</p>

<p class="right">
K. Rayner, Solicitor of the Treasury.’”<br>
</p>

<p class="center no-indent">(<em>Holds out paper to her.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What does he mean? I am sure God has permitted
me to fill this position, and (<em>reverently</em>) if He had not
permitted it, and helped me, too, I never could have done it
so well. How unjust this man is! Oh, Mr. Rayner! can
you not comprehend that, when a woman <em>can do</em> a man’s
work, she ought to have the legal right? (<em>Comes forward,
takes the paper, and reads to herself. To him</em>) But
see, Mr. Romberg. Here is something else about it; something
from the Secretary of the Treasury. (<em>Reads</em>) “The
United States Revised Statutes say that whenever any person
applies to be licensed, the inspectors shall diligently inquire
as to the character of the person, whether male or
female. I see no reason, then, in unwritten or in written law,
why Mistress Miller may not lawfully demand an examination;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
and, if she proves herself duly qualified, have a license
to serve as master of a vessel. Let the local inspectors carefully
examine her, and if they are satisfied that she can be
safely intrusted with the duties and responsibilities of a
master of a steam vessel, let them grant her a license,
according to section 4439.</p>

<p class="right">
Chas. J. Folger, Secretary of the Treasury.”<br>
</p>

<p>Bless him for that! He may make it all right. You see,
Mr. Romberg, it is not fully decided. I may get the license
yet. (<span class="smcap">Phus</span> <em>looks up from his book</em>.) I have been examined;
and when I told the inspectors all about that large
boat that got stuck up the river, near Cairo, and that we had
the chance to take off the loaded barges, and how I had them
made fast to us, took the wheel myself, turned the big boat
round, and carried her safely into Cairo, they looked surprised
enough. And one of them said that I did seem to be
qualified. Phus remembers it, the visit of the inspectors;
don’t you, Phus?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phus</span> (<em>jumping up and putting his whole hand in the
book for a mark</em>). O, yes, mis’! dem two gem’man, one
wid de black bandanna on he hat, de oder wid de gaiters!
De las’ one, he say, “You culled pusson, tel’ me troo, your

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> What did you tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phus.</span> I sez, “No! On’y when mis’ restin’, an’ it’s cam

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> The other owners say, and the newspapers, too,
that you have no chance; and we are all so certain of it that
we have agreed not to take away the boat if you do get the
license.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Do you think yourselves so certain as that?
Very well. But I have faith to believe that you will all wish
that you had not made that promise, unless you really want
me to have the boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Oh, madam! we’ve no notion you’ll get it. The
other owners scorn the idea of a woman captain, and so do I.
It’s ridiculous! (<em>Walks about.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>seating himself near</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>). When did you hear
from your husband last?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Not for a long time. I can’t think what the reason
is. I expected to find a letter here, but haven’t
received any. Phus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phus</span> (<em>jumping up in terror, and then relieved</em>). Oh!
it’s on’y mis’. Yaas! yaas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Phus, you go to the post-office, and see if there are
any letters. The post-man may not know that we have

<p><span class="smcap">Phus.</span> Yaas, mis’. (<em>Puts book on the wheel-house, and

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> He went out with a fishing-fleet, didn’t he, from
Gloucester?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Yes; why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Well, there have been a good many fishing-boats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>

What was the name of his boat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> The Betsey Ludgitt, Captain Zabulon Miller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> That’s the name of one of them, I think. Here’s
the shipping list. It says (<em>he reads</em>), “Several vessels

Ludgitt, Captain Zab—”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>rising in alarm</em>). Merciful Heaven! it cannot

if such a dreadful thing had happened to William. I cannot

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> He <em>may</em> be safe; but the probabilities are that
he is lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh! do not say that again. I cannot and will not
believe it. (<em>Goes to the hammock, and bends over it.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>approaching</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <em>in an insinuating way</em>). My
dear—madam, if anything should happen to your husband,
remember (<em>smiling</em>) that you have a warm friend in me. I
will give you as good a home as there is on the river, and
take your child, too. Yes! yes! I’ll take your child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>turning suddenly upon him</em>). Give me a home?
Take my child? What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> Why, I mean that I’ll marry you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Marry me? Who gave you the right to say
you’d marry me, or take my baby? William’s child! How
dare you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> I don’t see as you can help yourself. You need
the protection of a man. You can’t have the boat; and you
certainly can’t get a living around here, with your hands tied
by that young one. And you’re too pretty a woman—(<em>Tries
to take her hand.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> (<em>indignantly</em>). Sir! you’ve said enough! You
may own my boat, and you may have the power to take her
from me; but you cannot have the wife of Captain William
Miller. I tell you, sir, that I would rather beg my way home
from door to door, with my child in my arms,—yes, I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
starve,—before I would be the wife of any man but my own
husband. Dead or alive, it makes no difference to me. He
is still my husband!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>aside</em>). Those down-East women beat the world.
The spunk they show—Yankee grit they call it—it’s amazing!
But, Gad! it makes her look handsomer than ever. (<em>To her,

you do or not, remember that I will always be your friend.
(<em>Smiling.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Sir! I shall <em>never</em> change my mind; and I forbid
you ever to mention this subject to me again. I want no
such friendship as yours. Good-morning! (<em>Turns from
him, and goes to the hammock.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. R.</span> (<em>apologetically</em>). Well, I’m sure I—(<em>Aside</em>) Gad!
I want her more than ever. (<em>To her</em>) You know I said if
you <em>did</em> get the license, we won’t take away the boat. I’m
sure you ought not to complain of that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>without turning</em>). Very well, sir—then, there is
nothing more to say. Good-morning.</p>

and walks about, sailor fashion.</em>)</p>

<p>J. Q. A. <em>I</em> was the first one to think of coming. And I
went to Boston on Jim Rosson’s engine, and got a chance as
train-boy to New York. And when marm found out I was
bound to come, she said pup should go, too. I wanted to
come and punch old Romberg’s head. (<em>Walks about and
inspects everything.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> But where did you get the money to come with,
father? and, John (<em>to</em> J. Q. A.), who paid your fare from New
York?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>J. Q. A. Why! I paid myself, of course. What do you
take me for? When I got to New York I got another chance
as train-boy, all the way through; and I’ve peddled out
water in a big-nosed coffee-pot from Annisport to New Orleans.
And sold books, too! And prize packages, and
things, and magazines. (<em>Calls</em>) “Harper’s! December
Harper’s! Baby Pathfinder! Puck! Peanuts! Gum
drops? (<em>Offers his basket to</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> You funny boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Well, yer see, yer marm—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>interrupting</em>). Sit down, father. (<em>Offers him a
camp-stool.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> No, I just ’s lives stand. (<em>Leans against railing.</em>)
Yer marm took boarders all summer, an’ she made me
take that money. She said ’twould never do any more good;
an’, then, Leafy Jane, she’s l’arnt the millinger’s trade, an’ she
giv’ me some o’ hern.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. I tried to get a pass for him, part way, at least;
but them railroad men are so mean they’ll never help a fellow
along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Haow is little Nate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh! he’s all right! Here he is, father. Come
and see him. (<em>They go together to the hammock.</em>) He
hasn’t been sick a day this summer. The dear little fellow!
He grows like a weed.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. (<em>at the hammock, aside</em>). A pig weed, I
s’pose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Yer see, Mary, yer trouble has set me ter thinkin’;
an’ when you wrote they was goin’ to take away yer boat,
just cos yer was a woman, by the great horn spoon, I was mad:
for yer a Gandy cl’ar through, a sea-cap’n born like all the
rest on us. And I’ve made up my mind that wimmin’s rights
must be worth suthin’ to wimmin, as well as men’s rights to
men. An’, as old Pete Rosson said, when he felt so bad
about yer losing the boat, “Sence a woman can’t allus hev
her husband or her father tew take care on her, she ort
to have the right to take care o’ herself, an’ then she can use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
it or not, as she wants tew.” An’ so I begin to think that I
don’t care if we do let ’em vote.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. (<em>examining the wheel</em>). Cracky! you can’t
make me believe that. I shall vote in five years, and I’m
sure I don’t want Leafy Jane taggin’ after me to the poles.
’Tain’t any place for girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Stop yer gab! Wait till yer ten year older
an’ then if yer up for <em>see</em>-lectman, yer’ll be glad enuf ter have
tem vote for <em>yaou</em>!</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Wouldn’t I make a healthy selectman? Yes, I
guess not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> An’—an’, Mary, I want to tell yer suthin’ else.
I gin in about yer mother’s caarf, an’ went an’ bought
her back. To be sure, she ain’t a caarf no longer, but a good
likely heifer; but yer mother sez the principle ’s just as
good as if she was jest born, or as old as Methuselum. An’
she’s tickled enuf abaout it, an’ she said men ain’t so bad
arter all, if yer can onny make ’em see what is wimmin’s jest
dues.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Why, Leafy Jane, how you’ve grown!</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Yes, and she feels bigger’n you do, and puts on
a plaguy sight more airs. She wants father (she calls him
par) to put an <em>e</em> in Gandy, ’cause she says it’s more genteel.—And
say! she don’t lithp (<em>lisp</em>) any more; the customers
laughed at her so for saying “yeth, thir.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span>). Where <em>in</em> the world ’d you come
from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<em>deliberately sitting, and removing bonnet, mitts,
etc.</em>). Waal, Nathan, we heerd of an exertion train daown
here, at redooced rates; an’ the boarders,—one on ’em’s
writin’ a book,—an’ wanted to be quiet,—said they’d take
the haouse furnished for tew months, and pay in advance.
And so Leafy an’ me come right along. She’s made a lot o’
bunnits this fall on her own accaount, so she’s quite a
haress (<em>heiress</em>).</p>

<p>L. J. Oh, mar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Yer see, par, we hadn’t time to write after we’d
made up our mind to start, an’ we cum a leetle

<p>L. J. (<em>whispers warningly</em>). Why, mar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span>—with the exertionists. (<em>Aside</em>). Why in the
world don’t he come? I’m tired o’ keepin’ it in. He said he
onny wanted to go ter the bank. (<em>To</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>) An’ then I
was afraid you or the baby—why! where <em>is</em> the baby? Do
les see him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> He’s asleep, mother. Here, come and see him.
Isn’t he a darling? (<em>They go to the hammock.</em>)</p>

<p>L. J. Oh, Mary, what made you name the baby Nathan?
I wish you had called him Herbert, Ernest, or Montmorenci.
It’s so much more genteel.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Montmorenci Miller! Cracky! wouldn’t that
be tony?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>L. J. (<em>scornfully</em>). Tony! (<em>Walks off with</em> <span class="smcap">Hank</span> <em>to

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<em>To</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>) We tole yer young man that
looks so much like Fred Douglass not ta tell yer who we
was.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. Marm won’t say “colored man.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> No, I won’t; I’m sick o’ readin’ on’t in the
newspapers. They’re allus sayin’ such a man, <em>colored</em>, had
his leg took off, or died, or suthin’. What difference
does it make, I should like to know, whether he’s colored or
not! He’s hurt all the same, ain’t he? an’ he’s a man, tew,
all the same, ain’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phus</span> (<em>aside</em>). Golly! I shall bust!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span>). How long can you stay? a good
while, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> (<em>steps forward, drawls</em>). I think we must start in
about three weeks from Monday, if all the signs come right.
(<em>To</em> <span class="smcap">Mary</span>) You see the excursion don’t last only till then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>in surprise</em>). <em>We</em> must start! What in the world
does this mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Wal, you see, Leafy and me, we’ve been a-writin’
back and forth sence the cap’n told me I’d better; an’ she’s
agreed to hev me, an’ go an’ live down to Nantucket. Grandfather’s
old, and my marm wants me to come home an’ settle
down an’ see to things. She says she’s tired o’ housekeeping,
and wants to see some young folks round.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. (<em>To</em> L. J.). ’Fore I’d marry a cook! Anybody
that feels as big as you do. Cookie Mudgitt! How are you,
Mrs. Cookie Mudgitt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Capt. G.</span> Hold your yorp! Hundreds of big men hev
ben cooks. There was the most worshipful G. M. of aour
Masonic Lodge, he used to be cook in Annisport Jail, an’
now he’s a ’surance man, an’ lives in a tarnal big haouse.
An’, then, there was a feller cooked on a ranch five year’, an’
they sent him to Congress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Oh, Hank! what shall we do without you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> I tho’t o’ that. But a nice French Creole feller<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
is takin’ my place to-day; an’ if he does well, p’r’aps you’ll
keep him. If not, I’ll find somebody else afore we go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<em>to</em> L. J.). When are you going to be married?</p>

<p>L. J. (<em>loftily</em>). As soon as we have made the needed
preparations. Henry will explain.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. (<em>to</em> <span class="smcap">Hank</span>). Then, that’s what you’re so
rigged up for, ain’t it, Bub? in all them sailor slops. You
look like a royal tar, a regular old Britisher.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank</span> (<em>sheepishly</em>). Why, yes; you see, Leafy, she likes
it. But as soon as the weddin’ is over (she wants me to be
married in ’em here on the boat), I mean to put the whole
rig away in my sea-chist, with them blasted books that deluded
me into goin’ to sea; an’ that will be the last of my
bein’ a sailor. I’ve had enough of it. Darn the bunks! I
want to sleep on a first-rate feather-bed the rest of my life.</p>

<p>L. J. Law! Henry. How you do talk!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> It’s a fact, Leafy, so there! (<em>He goes up to her
and tries to kiss her.</em>)</p>

<p>L. J. (<em>pushing him away</em>). There! that will do, Henry.
That’s seven times to-day since I came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Is it? Well, ’tain’t any too many, anyhow!</p>

<p>J. Q. A. You great galloot! Catch me ever being such a
fool. Say! what kind of a necktie you going to wear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hank.</span> Oh, a stunner! blue and yallar, I guess. (<em>Looks
at</em> L. J.) Sha’n’t I, Leafy?</p>

<p>L. J. (<em>with dignity</em>). No, Henry; you must have one to
match my dress.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. (<em>to</em> L. J.). ’Fore I’d go taggin’ way down to New
Orleans after a husband!</p>

<p>L. J. You’ll have to tag all round the world before you’ll
find any one fool enough to wed <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>J. Q. A. I don’t think I shall ever “wed.” My affections
have been blighted by a fair damsel from Chicago. She had
large feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Stop, John Quincy! Yer as sarsy daown
here as yer was ter hum; ain’t ye l’arnt nothin’ by
travellin’?</p>
